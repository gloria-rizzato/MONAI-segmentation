# Parasagittal dura (PSD) segmentation tool 

The project aimed to segment parasagittal dura (PSD) from 3D-FLAIR sequence in a pediatric population (2-10 years old).
The algorithm was developed in [**MONAI**<br>](https://monai.io/) which is a freely available, community-supported, PyTorch-based framework for deep learning in healthcare imaging.

A pre-trained 3D-UNet is provided and it can be used for inference on new data using the scripts in (mettere il path alla cartella che ci sar√† su github). 
Please, make sure you have downloaded the folder (link alla folder) for inference on new data.



## Data

To segment PSD and to calculate its volume, please make a main directory (called for example *PSD_inference*). In this main directory create 2 sub-directories called *subjects* and *scripts*, respectively. In the *scripts* directory make sure to insert all the required scripts (see folder e mettere link alla folder su github). In the *subjects*  create new sub-directories (for example, you can call the sub-directories with the ID of the subjects) and insert the following files:

- Raw 3D-FLAIR sequence (named *raw_FLAIR*) in .nii.gz format
- AC, PC masks (named *AC* and *PC*, respectively) in .nii.gz format
